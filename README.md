## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The analysis is based on the following tables:

- **customers**: customer_id, first_name, last_name, gender, signup_date, region  
- **orders**: order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_status, payment_mode, order_amount  
- **order_items**: order_id, product_id, quantity, price  
- **products**: product_id, product_name, category  

> Note: `order_amount` was created as a derived metric using order_items to standardize revenue calculations across analyses.

## 📌 Executive Summary
The platform generates **~₹407K in total revenue**, driven primarily by **one-time buyers**, indicating strong initial purchase value but weak retention. While product demand and category performance are healthy, growth is constrained by **low repeat purchases**, **order cancellations (~₹97K revenue loss)**, and **revenue stuck in pending/processing orders**.  

The analysis highlights opportunities to grow revenue **without increasing customer acquisition**, by improving fulfillment efficiency, reducing cancellations, and converting valuable first-time buyers into repeat customers.
